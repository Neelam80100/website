The Fords' kitchen postrenovation. They opted for white GE appliances that have "a bit of an older feel to them,
" with stainless steel hardware that plays off the fridge; bar stools are from Serena & Lily (and, according to Amber, very easy to clean).

They scrapped half of these upper cabinets and laid new hardwood where there wasn't any before
 ("we picked a plank bigger in size [than the adjacent flooring], so it didn't look like we were trying to match it perfectly," Adam says).

Wary of opting for trends they'd later regret, the couple's decisions skewed highly practical. 
They opted for open shelves on one side of the kitchen to house their most frequently used supplies, 
but white upper cabinets on the other side. Quartz countertops with a little visible grain made more sense than high-maintenance marble,
 and subway tile was a no-brainer-except they opted for squares rather than rectangles just to keep it from feeling too Pinteresty. 
A local cabinetmaker matched a soft green Farrow & Ball shade for the lower cabinets, "to bring in a little color but not make it too overwhelming."

The breakfast table just across from the kitchen.
 The pastel palette of this artwork inspired all their color choices, and the bistro light, from Schoolhouse Electric, is their favorite in the house.

Conveniently, Amber's dad is "very handy," which seems to be putting it lightly.
 He not only custom-built a banquette for added storage in the breakfast area, 
but also carefully leveled and trimmed the baseboards to match the lines of the rolling floor so there wouldn't be any gaps.
 He added long drawers, one to pull out from either end of the bench, 
and solved an outlet crisis by wiring one to the outside of the banquette so that it wasn't lost with the addition.
 The couple planned for added storage like this in both the kitchen and bath even though they don't really need it yet. 
"We kept asking ourselves how we could grow into the space if we're still living in it in 15 years, if we have kids," Adam explains,
 "because ultimately you're not going to get less things over time."

<h1>THE BATH</h1>

 Black tile floors and a floating vanity are "classic but fresh," as Amber describes their style.

 The brand-new gleaming white tub (they had to remove the feet to get it through the closet-size door). 
The Lulie Wallace nude is a prized piece of art. "I always wanted to get a nude painting and then we finally found one that felt tasteful," Adam says.

</p></figure>
</div>



<p  style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #6699ff 0%, #ffffcc 100%);">

To maximize space (and meet code) in the closet-size bath, 
they laid out various configurations on drawing paper and were secretly delighted to realize that a floating vanity was their best bet.
 "It was kind of nice because it gave us an excuse to get one," Amber says, "even though it doesn't seem practical for storage reasons. 
It's a lot more cost-effective as well." They solved the storage quandary by mounting shelves-shallow ones by the sink,
 deeper ones above the toilet-and painting a stool from the thrift store to act as the towel rack.
 But before all that came the tile (another masterpiece from Amber's dad ).

Clad in shiplap and hand-molded subway tiles, the new kitchen is just the right amount of nautical.

Balancing out the open-concept space did wonders.
 Flanigan switched out the stout original upper cabinets with double-stacked versions that reach the ceiling and can stand up to the towering fireplace across the way.

Flanigan simplified the living room with a clean-lined fireplace facade (and, of course, more shiplap).

"The original living space felt heavy," Flanigan recalls, "due largely in part to the buttery yellow wall color and shades that covered every window."

To make sure nothing felt too jarring in the serene new master bedroom, Flanigan chose pieces with raw or gray-washed finishes.

The master bedroom's sitting area is similarly bright and airy. "Panoramic views of the bay are now framed by breezy sheers and woven wood Roman shades, 
an upgrade from the brutish blackout shades that were previously in their place," says Flanigan.
